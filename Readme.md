Small docker image based on alpine to contain hugo, the small webpage
generator (https://gohugo.io). 

This image is created to work with bitbucket pipelines
(https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines).

Inspired by the article here:
http://www.stevestreeting.com/2017/04/17/automated-deployment-of-hugo-blogs-with-bitbucket-pipelines--rsync/

(which of course didn't have the source Dockerfile, so I made my own)
